This is a PHP client library to manage DirectAdmin control panel servers. We simply decided to develop this as we needed
automation of our own DirectAdmin servers, and the existing implementations were unsupported and incomplete.

[API documentation for this project is automatically generated on each push](https://omines.github.io/directadmin/api/).

## Changed / Added

The recommended way to install this library is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):
```bash
composer require omines/directadmin
```

If you're not familiar with `composer` follow the installation instructions for
[Linux/Unix/Mac](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx) or
[Windows](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows), and then read the
[basic usage introduction](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md).

## Dependencies

The library uses [Guzzle 6](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) as its HTTP communication layer. PHP versions supported
are 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 and hhvm.

## Basic usage

To set up the connection use one of the base functions:

```php
use Omines\DirectAdmin\DirectAdmin;

$adminContext = DirectAdmin::connectAdmin('http://hostname:2222', 'admin', 'pass');
$resellerContext = DirectAdmin::connectReseller('http://hostname:2222', 'reseller', 'pass');
$userContext = DirectAdmin::connectUser('http://hostname:2222', 'user', 'pass');
```

These functions return an
[`AdminContext`](https://omines.github.io/directadmin/api/class-Omines.DirectAdmin.Context.AdminContext.html),
[`ResellerContext`](https://omines.github.io/directadmin/api/class-Omines.DirectAdmin.Context.ResellerContext.html), and
[`UserContext`](https://omines.github.io/directadmin/api/class-Omines.DirectAdmin.Context.UserContext.html)
respectively exposing the functionality available at the given level. All three extend eachother as DirectAdmin uses a
strict is-a model. To act on behalf of a user you can use impersonation calls:

```php
$resellerContext = $adminContext->impersonateReseller($resellerName);
$userContext = $resellerContext->impersonateUser($userName);
```
Both are essentially the same but mapped to the correct return type. Impersonation is also done implicitly
when managing a user's domains:

```php
$domain = $adminContext->getUser('user')->getDomain('example.tld');
```
This returns, if the domain exists, a [`Domain`](https://omines.github.io/directadmin/api/class-Omines.DirectAdmin.Objects.Domain.html)
instance in the context of its owning user, allowing you to manage its email accounts et al transparently.

## Contributions

As the DirectAdmin API keeps expanding pull requests are welcomed, as are requests for specific functionality.
Pull requests should in general include proper unit tests for the implemented or corrected functions.

For more information about unit testing see the `README.md` in the tests folder.
